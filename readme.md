### Eloquent Javascript exercises

These are some of the exercises I'm working through.

If you've stumbled on this, please do make sure that you work through the problems yourself -- the struggles you face is what enables you to learn.

Nevertheless, this may be of benefit to some, and is of benefit to myself.

### Tests

I prefer to learn things and code via tests. I've used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for that purpose. You'll need to set up yarn or npm to install jest, and then you can run the tests yourself, if you wish.
