### Eloquent Javascript exercises

These are some of the exercises I'm working through.

If you've stumbled on this, please do make sure that you work through the problems yourself -- the struggles you face is what enables you to learn.

Nevertheless, this may be of benefit to some, and is of immense benefit to myself. These answers are by no means model answers.

## Notes

I like writing code with test. I've used Jest to help out. First you will need to download and install Yarn. And after that, you will need to install jest - again, this can be done using yarn. You can then write the test and run it with a simple `yarn test` and you're off to the races!
